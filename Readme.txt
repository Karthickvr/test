Project Assessment:
    Cross Exchange is an arbitrarily trading game developed by a startup in a very short period called "Super Traders". 
    The purpose of the application is to educate users on the terminology used in the trading of shares.

Notes:
    - The project registers share and allows admins to add the new price of the share on an hourly basis and update last price value at any time.
    - The share registered should have unique Symbol to identify it and should be all capital letters with three characters.
    - The trade action can be BUY or SELL uppercase.
    - The rate of the share should be up to 2 decimal digits.
    - The daily, weekly and monthly summary contains four rates Open / High / Low / Close. Open is a first price in the given period; High is the highest price in the given period; Low is the lowest price in the given period and Close is the last price in the given period.
    - The frontend application is excluded from the current scope. It is a separate, fully-functional application handled by another team, and we do not want to modify it.
    - The frontend team expect API endpoints as agreed earlier and won't accept changes.
    - The frontend team accept API response status codes 200, 201, 400, 404. Other response codes are not allowed.
    - Product Chief Software Architect requires to stick with current system design and will not accept any changes to VS solution file and project architecture.

Tasks:

[Done]    1) For a given symbol of share, get the daily, weekly and monthly summary for that particular share calculating the Open / High / Low / Close prices for the given period for that share. 

    Your goal is to complete the above task for a given three API endpoints. The API specifications are already there in the code (AnalyticsController) as agreed with the frontend team. 

    2) There are a few bugs in the application that we would like you to fix. Even though the project might not be in a great structure, please do not spend your valuable time on structural modifications - focus on fixing the bugs. Please note that there are some issues already reported by the team: 
[Fixed]        - The team noticed that sometimes there are duplicate records for the hourly rate.
[Fixed]        - The team identified shares with unexpected rates which do not match with data from other sources.
[Fixed]        - The team found trade records in the database with an unexpected value in the action column.
[Fixed]        - The team reports that they get 500 response code sometimes from "/api/share/{symbol}/latest" call.

    3) Increase unit test coverage to reach code coverage up to 60%, achieving more than 60% will only consume your valuable time without any extra score.
    
    4) Some unit tests failing now, make sure all unit tests are passing.
    

    PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL OF THE TASKS LISTED ABOVE ARE MANDATORY.

    We will evaluate your submission on the following parameters:
        - Implementation of the new feature
        - Bug fixes
        - Unit Tests
        - Code quality

    Prerequisites:
         - GIT
         - VS2017
         - .NET Core 2.0
         - SQL Server 2012+


   Development Environment:
        Cross Exchange application:
        
        - Modify the database connection string as per your instance and authentication.
        - On any terminal move to the "XOProject.Api" folder (the folder containing the "XOProject.Api.csproj" file) and execute these commands:

        dotnet restore
        dotnet build
        dotnet ef database update
        dotnet run

        - Now you can call the API using any tool, like Postman, Curl, etc 
        
        - To check code coverage, execute the batch script:
        coverage.bat

   Production Environment:
        This is how we are going to run and evaluate your submission, so please make sure to run below steps before submitting your answer.

        1) Make sure to run unit tests, check code coverage, ensure the application is compiling and all dependencies included.
        2) Zip the entire codebase as XoProject_<yournamehere>.zip (removing /bin and /obj directories).
        4) Store your file in a shared location (only Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive allowed) where Crossover team can access and download it for evaluation, and add your sharable link in the answer field of this question.
